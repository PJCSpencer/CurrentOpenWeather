## Current Weather Data
Another coding challenge, the implementation for creating a url request has matured a little with automated header generation. Although not supported in this project.

To build and run the project first sign up for an account here: \
https://openweathermap.org/api 

Once a new account is registered, under the API Keys tab generate a new API key here: \
https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys

In the file PJCAPISecurity.swift copy and paste the new key in to the enum PJCAPISecurityKey for 'appid', marked 'copyAPIKeyHere'.
